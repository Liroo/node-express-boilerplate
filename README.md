# Node Express Boilerplate - A modern API boilerplate ðŸŒ¼

> I have no intention to produce a stable open-sourced version of this boilerplate for now. You can use it at your own risk.

### Instalation

##### Install the packages:

`yarn`

##### Scripts:

| cmd  | desc |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `yarn start`  | Start the bundler with hot reloading  |
| `yarn build`  | Bundle the API in production mode  |
| `yarn prod`   | Start the API in production mode (build needed before)  |
| - | -  |
| `yarn lint-check`   | Lint check on /api  |
| `yarn test`   | Run tests  |
| `yarn commit` | Commit with citizen |

> I do not use pm2 in the commands or any tools in order to optimize the cluster. I highly recommand to use some of these tools on your own way.

### Features

> I always try to maintain packages to the last version

- [ExpressJS](https://github.com/expressjs/express) for http server
- [Mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose) for the mongodb interface (for now, you have to install mongodb on your own way)

- [Nodemailer](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer) with a pug templating for send mail
